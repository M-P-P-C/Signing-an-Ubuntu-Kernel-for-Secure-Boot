# Signing a Linux Kernel for Secure Boot
A step-by-step guide on how to install and sign a Linux kernel to boot with Secure Boot, because it shouldn't be so hard to have the latest drivers for your machine.

I do not guarantee this will work with your machine, so do it at your own risk. Although in a scenario in which the new kernel won't boot it should be possible to rollback to the working one.

(This is currently a work in progress, so not all information is final and more will be added in the future)

# Why
Hardware vendors, such as Intel, have started to disable features if Secure Boot is not enabled, which could leave a Linux distro completely unable to use integrated graphics. On top of that, some drivers are only now provided through new Kernel releases, so there is no easy way to install the drivers you may need. These problems will be more relevant with laptop installations of Linux.

I spent a long time trying to battle against Secure Boot not letting me install new kernels, because you need to sign them images yourself, and the guides I've found on how to do so tend to be aimed towards system administrators who know more than a general Linux user. So I decided to put a clear step-by-step guide because I think everyone deserves the latest Linux kernels.

# How
To cover the process beginning to end we'll separate it into two steps: installing a kernel, and signing it for Secure Boot.

## Installing a Kernel

First you can check which kernel version you are currently using with:

```console
uname -r
```

In your directory of choice create a folder were you can place the files we'll handle during this process.

We can get the kernel files from [Ubuntu's Mainline repository](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D), note that kernels that end with "-rcX" are "Release Candidate" builds that may not be as stable. For a 64-bit architecture (amd64) you can download the following 4 files:

* linux-headers-&ltversion-num&mt_all.deb
* linux-headers-<version-num>_amd64.deb
* linux-image-<version-num>_amd64.deb
* linux-modules-<version-num>_amd64.deb

</p>


Put all the downloaded packages into a folder, then within that folder install the downloaded files with:

```console
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

## Signing a Kernel for Secure Boot
Once the kernel has been installed we can proceed to siging it for Secure Boot.
 
### Create a Key
 
In the same folder we used for installing the kernels, create a file named "**mokconfig.cnf**", place the following text, and change the text inside "<>": (you may also download the template file from [here](#here))
 
```bash
cat > mokconfig.cnf
```
 
<details>
  <summary>Click to view text for mokconfig.cnf</summary>
 
```
# This definition stops the following lines failing if HOME isn't defined.
HOME                    = .
RANDFILE                = $ENV::HOME/.rnd 
[ req ]
distinguished_name      = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions         = v3
string_mask             = utf8only
prompt                  = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName             = <YOURcountrycode>
stateOrProvinceName     = <YOURstate>
localityName            = <YOURcity>
0.organizationName      = <YOURorganization>
commonName              = Secure Boot Signing Key
emailAddress            = <YOURemail>

[ v3 ]
subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer
basicConstraints        = critical,CA:FALSE
extendedKeyUsage        = codeSigning,1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.6
nsComment               = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
```
</details>
 
within the same directory run the following command to create our MOK key:

```bash
 openssl req -config ./mokconfig.cnf \
        -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -nodes -days 36500 -outform DER \
        -keyout "MOK.priv" \
        -out "MOK.der"
```

IF IT RETURNS THE ERROR Can't load /home/USER/.rnd into RNG you may just run the command again as the .rng file was not in the specified location
 
to sign the kernel we need to convert the key to PEM format for "sbsign" to work with it:
 
```console
openssl x509 -in MOK.der -inform DER -outform PEM -out MOK.pem
```

Let's enroll our new MOK key into our shim installation:
 
```console 
sudo mokutil --import MOK.der
```
you'll be asked for a **password**, you'll need it after rebooting the computer.
 
### Signing the Kernel

Now that we have a key, we can sign the kernel images we installed before. We can do so with the following command, make sure to replace your installed version
 
```console 
sudo sbsign --key MOK.priv --cert MOK.pem /boot/vmlinuz-[KERNEL-VERSION]-generic --output /boot/vmlinuz-[KERNEL-VERSION]-generic.signed
```

Before we commit to booting with the installed kernel we just signed, we'll test it out by restarting the computer and selecting it manually
 
### Rebooting Computer To Complete Key Signature
 
With all the necessary work done on Linux, we now need to approve the kernel signature within the SHIM environment

Then, type the password you defined at the end of the [Create a Key](#create-a-key) section:

</p>

Finally, reboot the computer and your signed kernel should work:

</p>
 
 ### Changing Default Kernel

Once you have confirmed your installation is stable with the new kernel you may decide to make that the default boot option. To do so you can go back to the terminal and use the following line (replacing the information to fit the name of your signed kernel)

```console
sudo cp /boot/initrd.img-[KERNEL-VERSION]-generic{,.signed}
```

 

# Resources
There are tools available that simplify the installation and management of Linux kernel in your machine, e.g. [Ukuu](https://teejeetech.in/2019/01/20/ukuu-v19-01/), its deprecated free version [Ukuu Github](https://github.com/teejee2008/ukuu), or its maintained open-source fork [Mainline](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline)
